# DaisySeedGFX
TFT graphical display library for Daisy Seed. ST7789 driver

## Author

## PrÃ©sentation
DaisySeedGFX is a graphical library for the Daisy Seed platform by Electrosmith.
The library currently only supports the ST7789 controller. I plan to quickly integrate the ST7735 controller. In principle, the library should be easily adaptable to any controller.

The library uses an intermediate frame buffer between the graphic primitives and the controller. Modifications made in the frame buffer are transmitted to the controller using SPI transfers under DMA. To reduce transfers, the frame buffer is divided into blocks -> only the modified blocks are transferred to the screen.

The graphic primitives are minimalist and can be completed according to needs.

## Configuration
The UserConfig.h file allows adapting the library to different hardware implementations.

The Font.h file is used to define the loaded fonts. Each font is described in a xxx.h file, which can be created using the tool https://rop.nl/truetype2gfx/.

## Development Tool
The code can be modified and compiled under VS Code in the Daisy Seed development environment (see https://github.com/electro-smith).

The Makefile must be adapted according to the location of the libraries:

LIBDAISY_DIR = ../../../Desktop/DaisyExamples/libDaisy/
DAISYSP_DIR = ../../../Desktop/DaisyExamples/DaisySP/


The c_cpp_properties.json file must also be adapted:

"includePath": [
  "${workspaceFolder}/**",
  "${workspaceFolder}/../../../Desktop/DaisyExamples/libDaisy/**",
  "${workspaceFolder}/../../../Desktop/DaisyExamples/DaisySP/**"
]

# Handheld Chord Synthesizer

A portable, open-source chord synthesizer built on the Electrosmith Daisy Seed platform. It features an interactive TFT display for navigating menus, selecting chords, and shaping sounds in real-time.

*(Suggestion: Replace `placeholder.jpg` with a real photo of your breadboarded synth! You can upload images directly to GitHub.)*

## Features

*   **Polyphonic Chord Engine:** Plays multi-voice chords based on the major scale.
*   **Dedicated Chord Buttons:** 7 physical buttons for instantly triggering the chords of the C Major scale (C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim).
*   **Interactive UI:** A color TFT screen with a menu system navigated by a rotary encoder and buttons.
*   **Sound Design:** On-device editing of sound parameters like ADSR envelope and filter cutoff.
*   **State Management:** A menu state machine that allows navigation between different settings screens (Main Menu, Chord Selection, Sound Design, etc.).

## Hardware

*   Electrosmith Daisy Seed
*   Color TFT Display (e.g., ST7735 or ILI9341)
*   Rotary Encoder with Push-button
*   10x Momentary Push Buttons
*   Breadboard and jumper wires

## How to Build and Run

1.  **Setup Toolchain:** Ensure you have the [Daisy development toolchain](https://electro-smith.github.io/DaisyWiki/docgod/getting-started-mac.html) set up.
2.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/gwell11/handheld-synthesizer.git`
3.  **Update Makefile:** Open the `Makefile` and verify that the `LIBDAISY_DIR` and `DAISYSP_DIR` variables point to the correct locations on your machine.
4.  **Build:** Run `make` in the project directory.
5.  **Flash:** Put the Daisy Seed in DFU mode and run `make program-dfu`.

## Project Status

This project was recently revived after being abandoned for about a year. The immediate goals are to refactor the code, fix bugs, and implement the remaining features.
